# Asteroids
A Java Asteroids game I made in 9th grade.
# Features
This is a relatively faithful recreation of the original Asteroids game with a few new things added on.

The gameplay consists of increasingly difficult waves, bringing more asteroids and more enemy ships every time. Your goal is to score as many points as possible by destroying these hostile enemies.

The basic controls are the left and right keys for turning, up for thrust, and space to shoot.

You can press the down key to slow down time, however this only lasts as long as you have the slowmo charged. The bar for slowmo slowly goes down as you use the ability, and will slowly come back as you do not use the ability. Watch out though, if you completely deplete your slowmo bar, you need to wait for it to fully recharge before using it again.

Press "p" to pause the game, and bring up the upgrade menu. You can use the arrow keys to navigate the menu, and press space to select the upgrade.

The gatling powerup will allow you to hold space to fire rapidly, but only while you are still. This is a little unwieldy to use, but very good for the boss.

The extra life powerup will give you an extra life.

The speed powerup will increase your acceleration, to get you out of sticky situations.

The slowmo powerup will increase how quickly your slowmo recharges.
